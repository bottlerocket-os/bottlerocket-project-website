The [ECS Updater GitHub repo](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-ecs-updater) has information on building, contributing to, or learning about the inner workings of ECS Updater, while this documentation covers the *usage* of the software.

## Organization

Each major or minor release of ECS Update gets it’s own namespaced, version-specific documentation.
Inside each version-specific sections are subsections that address specific workflows and categories of information.

## Something Missing?

This [documentation is open-source](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-project-website/tree/main/content/en/ecs-updater) and likely incomplete, but will evolve over time to encompass a more complete explanation of the software.
Should you find gaps, you’re invited to file issues or contribute.
