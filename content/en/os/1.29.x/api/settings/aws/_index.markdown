Only pertinent on `aws-*` variants or on other variants in conjunction with [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html), these settings are automatically gathered using instance metadata.
Typically, you do not need to explicitly populate these settings, however you can manually override these settings using the API for testing or other purposes.
