This section is currently incomplete and represents a subset of available settings. Each setting group (i.e. `settings.*`) will be ported over as a unit. If the setting group you're interested in exists, consider that _group_ to be complete.

See [Description of Settings](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#description-of-settings) on the Bottlerocket README for the definitive list until this notice is removed.
