This section covers installing and using the **Bottlerocket operating system**.
If you’re looking for information on building, contributing to, or learning about the inner workings of Bottlerocket, the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket) has more information.

## Organization

The Bottlerocket documentation is organized by minor version, with each minor release getting it’s own namespaced, version-specific section. Inside each version-specific sections are subsections which address specific tasks or categories of information.

The current documented versions:

## Related Projects

Non-OS Bottlerocket projects are covered in other sections ([Bottlerocket Update Operator documentation](../brupop/)) or on their respective GitHub Repos[^1] ([Control Container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container), [Admin Container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container), [Bottlerocket ECS Updater](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-ecs-updater), etc.)

## Something Missing?

Bottlerocket, like any operating system, is complex and rich with options and configuration. This [documentation is open-source](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/project-website) and likely incomplete, but will evolve over time to encompass a more complete explanation of the software. Should you find gaps, you’re invited to file issues or contribute.

[^1]: In the future, documentation on the use and installation of these tools may migrate to a new section on this site.
