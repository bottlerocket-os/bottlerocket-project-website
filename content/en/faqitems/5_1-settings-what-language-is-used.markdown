When defining settings in [user data](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#using-user-data), Bottlerocket uses [TOML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/toml/).
Some settings have examples available for reference, such as [the container image registry settings](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#container-image-registry-settings).
