The proxy settings configure the behaviour of several services depending on your variant:

- On **all variants** proxy settings affect [containerd.service](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/packages/containerd/containerd.service) and [host-containerd.service](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/packages/host-ctr/host-containerd.service).
- On **Kubernetes variants** (`*-k8s-*`) proxy settings also affect the [kubelet.service](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/packages/kubernetes-1.18/kubelet.service).
- On **ECS variants** (`*-ecs-*` and `*-ecs-2-*`) proxy settings also affect the [docker.service](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/packages/docker-engine/docker.service) and the [ecs.service](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/packages/ecs-agent/ecs.service).

Sets the hostname of the node to the defined value.

Typically, you do not need to change this setting; in the majority of the cases the default will suffice.

If unset, DNS reverse lookup determines the hostname.
If DNS reverse lookup fails, the hostname is the IP address of the node.
