heading = "Supported NVIDIA Container Runtime modes"

Bottlerocket supports both the [Legacy] and the [Container Device Interface] (CDI) modes provided by NVIDIA.

##### Setting the default CRI runtime mode

To enable the CDI mode for the default CRI runtime and disable the legacy runtime, you can set `device-list-strategy` of the `nvidia-k8s-device-plugin` to `cdi-cri`. Setting either `volume-mounts` or `envvar` will enable the Legacy mode for the default CRI runtime.
Refer to the Examples section for code samples to configure the CRI runtimes.

##### Enabling both Legacy and CDI modes

Bottlerocket supports enabling both the Legacy and CDI modes at the same time. 
This is useful if you need to run pods using a combinations of both the Legacy and the CDI modes. 
To support this use case, Bottlerocket provides the following CRI runtimes:
* `nvidia` (default CRI runtime used by the kubelet)
* `nvidia-cdi`
* `nvidia-legacy`

In order to use either `nvidia-cdi` or `nvidia-legacy`, you must create the corresponding [Runtime Classes] in your cluster so that they are available for your pods. 
You can use the following runtime class definition examples to create the runtimes in your cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: nvidia-cdi
handler: nvidia-cdi
---
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: nvidia-legacy
handler: nvidia-legacy
```

After you have created the runtime classes, you can enable them by setting multiple device list strategies in the `nvidia-k8s-device-plugin`. 
When enabling both modes keep in mind that:
* Only a subset of configurations enable both modes (e.g. providing `["envvar", "volume-mounts"]` doesn't enable both modes)
* The mode of the default runtime is selected based off the first element in the list of device list strategy

This table summarizes how you can enable either CDI for the default runtime, or both CDI and Legacy modes:

Bottlerocket supports NVIDIA’s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) feature on Kubernetes nodes through the [nvidia-k8s-device-plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#with-cuda-time-slicing).
This functionality enables system administrators to partition the node’s GPU(s) into several separate GPU instances, which can then be assigned to individual pods for executing various workloads.
To learn more about MIG and its options, please take a look at the NVIDIA documentation, like their [Official Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/kubernetes/latest/index.html), [Kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#nvidia-device-plugin-for-kubernetes) and [technical blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improving-gpu-utilization-in-kubernetes/#multi-instance_gpu_mig).

<h5>Lifecycle</h5>

MIG configuration can be defined through user-data or apiclient for an instance running Bottlerocket Kubernetes NVIDIA variant.
The profile (number of partitions) applied to the GPUs is dependent on the GPU model. \
Modifications to the MIG configuration will not affect the node immediately, allowing existing workloads to continue in the node. The node needs to be restarted to allow draining the node. \
The MIG configuration is then applied at boot time by a `systemd` service.

<h5>Use Cases</h5>

The MIG feature is disabled by default in Bottlerocket. This feature provides memory and fault isolation at the hardware layer as described [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/gpu-sharing.html#comparison-time-slicing-and-multi-instance-gpu).
According to [NVIDIA](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/kubernetes/latest/index.html#mig-support-in-kubernetes), this feature is beneficial for workloads that do not fully saturate the GPU’s compute capacity and therefore users may want to run different workloads in parallel to maximize utilization.

<h5>Customer Advisory</h5>

When MIG is enabled, NVLinks are <b>NOT</b> supported as mentioned in [NVIDIA Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/fabric-manager-user-guide/index.html#interoperability-with-mig).

<h5>Example Usage</h5>

In a node with Bottlerocket Kubernetes NVIDIA variant, if the following configuration were applied, the plugin would enable MIG and apply `2g.10gb` profile on nodes with <b>NVIDIA A100 40GB</b> GPUs (3 partitions) and apply `1g.20gb` profile on nodes with <b>NVIDIA H100 80GB</b> GPUs (4 partitions).
If we assume, they are P4 and P5 instances respectively with 8 GPUs, the plugin would advertise 24 (8 GPUs x 3 partitions) and 32 (8 GPUs x 4 partitions) `nvidia.com/gpu` resources to Kubernetes instead of 8. The `nvidia-k8s-device-plugin` creates the required number of references to each GPU and distributes them to any requestor.

description = """
Bottlerocket supports NVIDIA GPU time-slicing on Kubernetes nodes through the [nvidia-k8s-device-plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#with-cuda-time-slicing).
This functionality enables system administrators to allocate a set of replicas on the node's GPU(s), which can then be assigned to individual pods for executing various workloads. \
To learn more about Time-Slicing and its options, please take a look at the NVIDIA documentation, like their [Kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#with-cuda-time-slicing) and [technical blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improving-gpu-utilization-in-kubernetes/).

<h5>Lifecycle</h5>

When time-slicing configuration is defined on a Bottlerocket Kubernetes node with NVIDIA GPU variants, the configuration is applied to all GPUs present on the node.
Modifications to the time-slicing configuration will affect the advertised resources available on the node.
Existing pods that were already running and consuming the GPU are not automatically removed or restarted.
Therefore, it is recommended to configure time-slicing settings before deploying pods to ensure consistency across all GPU workloads.

<h5>Use Cases</h5>

The time-slicing feature is disabled by default in Bottlerocket. This feature does not provide memory or fault isolation between replicas, and has unique resource request behavior as described [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#with-cuda-time-slicing).
According to [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improving-gpu-utilization-in-kubernetes/#virtualization_with_vgpu), this feature is best used for over subscribing the GPU when needing to run multiple applications that are not latency-sensitive or can tolerate jitter.

<h5>Example Usage</h5>

In a Bottlerocket Kubernetes NVIDIA variant, if the below configuration were applied to a node with 8 GPUs on it, the plugin would now advertise 80 `nvidia.com/gpu.shared` resources to Kubernetes instead of 8 (8 GPU’s x 10 replicas = 80).
The nvidia-k8s-device-plugin creates 10 references to each GPU and distributes them to any requestor. For behavior details, please refer to [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/gpu-sharing.html#about-configuring-gpu-time-slicing).
