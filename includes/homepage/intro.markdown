Bottlerocket is a Linux-based operating system optimized for hosting containers.
It’s free and open-source software, developed in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os).
Bottlerocket is installed as the base operating system on the machine or instance where your containers themselves are running.
It is specifically designed to work with your container orchestrator (like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)) to automate the lifecycle of the containers running in your cluster.
Bottlerocket runs in the cloud or in your datacenter.

Bottlerocket has three primary goals: [Minimal](#minimal) · [Safe Updates](#safe-updates) · [Security Focused](#security-focused).
